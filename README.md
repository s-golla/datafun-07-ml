# datafun-07-ml

A small machine learning project template and exercises for the "DataFun" series (episode 07).

This repository contains the code, environment requirements, and instructions to run experiments, train models, and evaluate results for the course/project. It is intentionally small and educational — ideal for learning the end-to-end ML workflow: data preparation, model training, evaluation, and packaging.

## Contents

- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies used by the project.
- `README.md` — this file.

If your repository contains additional folders such as `data/`, `notebooks/`, `src/`, or `models/`, they will be described below.

## Quick start

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):

    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the example or training script (adjust path if needed):

    ```powershell
    python src/train.py
    ```

    If you don't have a `src/train.py`, check the repository for the main script or a `notebooks/` folder and open the notebook in your preferred environment.

## Project structure (recommended)

This project uses a simple, conventional layout. Your repository may vary.

- data/ — raw and processed datasets (not checked into source control unless small and anonymized).
- notebooks/ — exploratory Jupyter notebooks and visualizations.
- src/ — Python package with training, evaluation, and utility code.
- models/ — saved model artifacts and checkpoints.
- requirements.txt — pinned Python dependencies.
- README.md — this file.

## Data

Place or download datasets into the `data/` directory. If the dataset is large, include a small script `scripts/download_data.py` to fetch it, or add instructions here explaining where to get the data and how to prepare it.

Example data preparation command:

```powershell
python src/prepare_data.py --input data/raw --output data/processed
```

## Usage

- Training a model:

    ```powershell
    python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml
    ```

- Evaluating a model:

    ```powershell
    python src/evaluate.py --model models/latest.pkl --data data/processed
    ```

- Running notebooks:

    Open files in `notebooks/` using Jupyter Lab or VS Code's notebook interface.

    ```powershell
    jupyter lab
    ```

## Development tips

- Keep dependencies pinned in `requirements.txt` for reproducibility.
- Use small subsets of the data during development to iterate faster.
- Add unit tests for data transformers and training components where possible.
